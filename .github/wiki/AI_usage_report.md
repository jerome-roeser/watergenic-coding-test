AI was used in the form of auto-completing tasks with Copilot (Claude Sonnet 3.5)


The main use of AI was made fro reptitive tasks such as `unit test` writing and `data validation` functions.

In every case the code was read, evaluated and (often) modified wiht minor fixes to obtain the desired behavior.


AI was also used to generate fucntion docstrings in numpy format. In this case as well the output was checked and adapted as required.
